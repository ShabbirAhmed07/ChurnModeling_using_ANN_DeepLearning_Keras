# ChurnModeling_using_ANN_DeepLearning_Keras 

Here we are developing simple Deep Learning ANN model using & keras library. 

## Dataset â€“ Churn_Modeling.

Churn is defined as movement of customer from one company to another.Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service, also known as customer attrition. It is also referred as loss of clients or customers.

The reasons can for example be :-

- Availability of latest technology  
-	Customer-friendly bank staff 
-	Low interest rates  
-	Location 
-	Services offered 
-	Churn rate usually lies in the range from 10% up to 30%.

This dataset includes 10000 rows and 14 feature variables. Predicting which set of the customers are going to churn out from the organization by analyzing into some of the important attributes and applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning on it.

## Code is Divided into three sections :-

-	Section 1 - Preprocessing of Data.
-	Section 2 - Actual making of ANN begins from here.
-	Section 3 - Making the predictions and evaluating the model.

## Comments :-

Will help to understand each steps, all are described by comments in each cell.
